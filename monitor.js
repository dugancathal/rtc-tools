  ### monitor

  ```js
  var monitor = require('rtc/monitor');
  ```

  In most current implementations of `RTCPeerConnection` it is quite
  difficult to determine whether a peer connection is active and ready
  for use or not.  The monitor provides some assistance here by providing
  a simple function that provides an `EventEmitter` which gives updates
  on a connections state.

  #### monitor(pc) -> EventEmitter

  <<< examples/monitor.js

  Events provided by the monitor are as follows:

  - `active`: triggered when the connection is active and ready for use
  - `stable`: triggered when the connection is in a stable signalling state
  - `unstable`: trigger when the connection is renegotiating.

  It should be noted, that the monitor does a check when it is first passed
  an `RTCPeerConnection` object to see if the `active` state passes checks.
  If so, the `active` event will be fired in the next tick.

  If you require a synchronous check of a connection's "openness" then
  use the `monitor.isActive` test outlined below.
**/
var monitor = module.exports = function(pc, tag) {
  // create a new event emitter which will communicate events
  var mon = new EventEmitter();
  var currentState = getState(pc);
  var isActive = mon.active = currentState === W3C_STATES.ACTIVE;

  function checkState() {
    var newState = getState(pc, tag);
    debug('captured state change, new state: ' + newState +
      ', current state: ' + currentState);

    // update the monitor active flag
    mon.active = newState === W3C_STATES.ACTIVE;

    // if we have a state change, emit an event for the new state
    if (newState !== currentState) {
      mon.emit(currentState = newState);
    }
  }

  // if the current state is active, trigger the active event
  if (isActive) {
    process.nextTick(mon.emit.bind(mon, W3C_STATES.ACTIVE, pc));
  }

  // start watching stuff on the pc
  pc.addEventListener('signalingstatechange', checkState);
  pc.addEventListener('iceconnectionstatechange', checkState);

  // patch in a stop method into the emitter
  mon.stop = function() {
    pc.removeEventListener('signalingstatechange', checkState);
    pc.removeEventListener('iceconnectionstatechange', checkState);
  };

  return mon;
};

/**
  #### monitor.getState(pc)

  Provides a unified state definition for the RTCPeerConnection based
  on a few checks.

  In emerging versions of the spec we have various properties such as
  `readyState` that provide a definitive answer on the state of the 
  connection.  In older versions we need to look at things like
  `signalingState` and `iceGatheringState` to make an educated guess 
  as to the connection state.
