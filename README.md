# rtc

The `rtc` package is a convenience layer for working with the rtc.io toolkit.
Consider it a boxed set of lego of the most common pieces required to build
the front-end component of a WebRTC application.

## Getting Started

TO BE COMPLETED.

## Factories

### createConnection(opts?, constraints?)

Create a new `RTCPeerConnection` auto generating default opts as required.

```js
var conn;

// this is ok
conn = rtc.createConnection();

// and so is this
conn = rtc.createConnection({
  iceServers: []
});
```

## connect-media

```js
var connectMedia = require('rtc/connect-media');
```

The `rtc/connect-media` helper module is a convenience helper for
associating an `rtc-media` capture source with a peer connection.  It
primarily does two things that are of major benefit:

1. if the media stream is ready adds it immediately, otherwise waits for a
   media `capture` event and adds the stream at that point.

2. Current WebRTC implementations in Firefox do not trigger relevant
   `negotiationneeded` events when a stream is added to a peer. This is
   important behaviour in rtc.io and the WebRTC spec, and thus this
   'connect-media` helper manually triggers that event once a stream is
   added (after a short delay).

### Example Usage

```js
var quickconnect = require('rtc-quickconnect');
var connectMedia = require('../connect-media');

// incldue the media module and immediately request to capture media
var media = require('rtc/media')();

// create a new quickconnection instance in the test namespace
quickconnect('test')
  .on('peer', function(conn) {
    // when a new peer is connected, connect the media instance
    // to the new connection which is coupled behind the scenes in quickconnect
    connectMedia(media, conn);
  });
```

## couple

```js
var couple = require('rtc/couple');
```

### couple(pc, targetAttr, signaller, opts?)

Couple a WebRTC connection with another webrtc connection via a
signalling scope.  The `targetAttr` argument specifies the criteria that
are passed onto a `/request` command when looking for remote peer
to couple and exchange messages with.

### Example Usage

```js
var couple = require('rtc/couple');

couple(new RTCPeerConnection(), { id: 'test' }, signaller);
```

### Using Filters

In certain instances you may wish to modify the raw SDP that is provided
by the `createOffer` and `createAnswer` calls.  This can be done by passing
a `sdpfilter` function (or array) in the options.  For example:

```js
// run the sdp from through a local tweakSdp function.
couple(pc, { id: 'blah' }, signaller, { sdpfilter: tweakSdp });
```

## rtc/detect

```js
var detect = require('rtc/detect');
```

Provide the [rtc-core/detect](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-core#detect) 
functionality.

## rtc/generators

The generators package provides some utility methods for generating
constraint objects and similar constructs.

```js
var generators = require('rtc/generators');
```

### generators.config(config)

Generate a configuration object suitable for passing into an W3C 
RTCPeerConnection constructor first argument, based on our custom config.

### generators.connectionConstraints(flags, constraints)

This is a helper function that will generate appropriate connection
constraints for a new `RTCPeerConnection` object which is constructed
in the following way:

```js
var conn = new RTCPeerConnection(flags, constraints);
```

In most cases the constraints object can be left empty, but when creating
data channels some additional options are required.  This function
can generate those additional options and intelligently combine any
user defined constraints (in `constraints`) with shorthand flags that
might be passed while using the `rtc.createConnection` helper.

### generators.mediaConstraints(flags, context)

Generate mediaConstraints appropriate for the context in which they are 
being called (i.e. either constructing an RTCPeerConnection object, or
on the `createOffer` or `createAnswer` calls).

### parseFlags(opts)

This is a helper function that will extract known flags from a generic 
options object.

## rtc/media

```js
var media = require('rtc/media');
```

Provide the core [rtc-media](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-media) for
convenience.

## monitor

```js
var monitor = require('rtc/monitor');
```

In most current implementations of `RTCPeerConnection` it is quite
difficult to determine whether a peer connection is active and ready
for use or not.  The monitor provides some assistance here by providing
a simple function that provides an `EventEmitter` which gives updates
on a connections state.

### monitor(pc) -> EventEmitter

```js
var monitor = require('rtc/monitor');
var pc = new RTCPeerConnection(config);

// watch pc and when active do something
monitor(pc).once('active', function() {
  // active and ready to go
});
```

Events provided by the monitor are as follows:

- `active`: triggered when the connection is active and ready for use
- `stable`: triggered when the connection is in a stable signalling state
- `unstable`: trigger when the connection is renegotiating.

It should be noted, that the monitor does a check when it is first passed
an `RTCPeerConnection` object to see if the `active` state passes checks.
If so, the `active` event will be fired in the next tick.

If you require a synchronous check of a connection's "openness" then
use the `monitor.isActive` test outlined below.

### monitor.getState(pc)

Provides a unified state definition for the RTCPeerConnection based
on a few checks.

In emerging versions of the spec we have various properties such as
`readyState` that provide a definitive answer on the state of the 
connection.  In older versions we need to look at things like
`signalingState` and `iceGatheringState` to make an educated guess 
as to the connection state.

### monitor.isActive(pc) -> Boolean

Test an `RTCPeerConnection` to see if it's currently open.  The test for
"openness" looks at a combination of current `signalingState` and
`iceGatheringState`.

## rtc/signaller

```js
var signaller = require('rtc/signaller');
```

Provide the core [rtc-signaller](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-signaller)
for convenience.

## Internal RTC Helper Libraries

The RTC library uses a number of helper modules that are contained within
the `lib/` folder of the `rtc-io/rtc` repository.  While these are designed
primarily for internal use, they can be accessed by directly requiring
the modules, e.g. `require('rtc/lib/helpermodule')`

## rtc/lib/listen

```js
var listen = require('rtc/lib/listen');

// listen for negotiation needed events
listen(pc).on('negotiationneeded', function(evt) {

});
```

The `listen` helper provides an event emitter for a peer connection object
that will bind to each of the core events WebRTC events (unless overriden
by providing the listen function additional arguments).
